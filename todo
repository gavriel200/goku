the client is the configuration on connection to the service.
splits into senders and consumers
senders sends to queues
consumers consume from queues

client configuration:
    sender/consumer
    queue - queue configuration

if a queue does not exists it creates it.
queue name must be uniq.

queue configuration:

on connection the server reds until new line - this will be the client configuration

how will the server be reading the data:
implement a protocol for example -
first byte is if its sender(00000000) or consumer(00000001)
the second byte is the length of the queue name max size (255)(uint)
then the name of the queue (array of bytes with the - name)

then the reader will start with reading the first byte to know what type of client it is
then the read the second byte to know how long the name is
then create a reader with the size of the queue name from before and then finish

when a consumer connects it should be added to the queue as a listener.
we could do a list or maybe a map on the queue struct.
